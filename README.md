## MEDprompt


The original MEDPrompt project for a **Gen AI framework and standard routines in healthcare** has been discontinued. I am developing something new for making GenAI easily accessible with a modular architecture based on [OpenMRS](https://openmrs.org/) and [LangServe](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/langserve/). An early prototype is expected by the end of August 2024.  [Please contact me](https://nuchange.ca/contact) if you are interested! 

This repository is **NOT** related to *Medprompt* method described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16452). Find it [here](https://github.com/microsoft/promptbase) instead!
